## Bio

Jeff is Chief Data Officer, Vice President, and J Orin Edson Foundation Chair of Biostatistics at the [Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center](https://www.fredhutch.org/). Previously, he was a professor of [Biostatistics](https://www.jhsph.edu/departments/biostatistics/) and [Oncology](https://www.rits.onc.jhmi.edu/dbb/) at the [Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health](https://www.jhsph.edu/) and co-director of the [Johns Hopkins Data Science Lab](https://jhudatascience.org/).  His group develops statistical methods, software, data resources, and data analyses that help people make sense of massive-scale genomic and biomedical data.  

As the co-director of the Johns Hopkins Data Science Lab he helped to develop massive online open programs that have enrolled more than 8 million individuals and partnered with community-based non-profits to [use data science education for economic and public health development](https://magazine.jhsph.edu/2019/data-science-careers-baltimores-underserved-community-members). As Chief Data Officer at Fred Hutch he has focused on [creating a robust and coordinated data ecosystem](https://ocdo.fredhutch.org/) for all members of the Fred Hutch community and beyond. 

He is a Fellow of the American Statistical Association and a recipient of the [Mortimer Spiegelman Award](https://spiegelmanaward.github.io/) and [Committee of Presidents of Statistical Societies Presidential Award](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COPSS_Presidents%27_Award).
