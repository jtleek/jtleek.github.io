The face of academia is changing. It is no longer sufficient to just publish or perish. We are now in an era where Twitter, Github, Figshare, and Alt Metrics are regular parts of the scientific workflow. Here I give high level advice about which tools to use, how to use them, and what to look out for. This book is appropriate for scientists at all levels who want to stay on top of the current technological developments affecting modern scientific careers. The book is based in part on the author's popular guides including guides for

* [Reading papers](https://github.com/jtleek/readingpapers)
* [Career planning](https://github.com/jtleek/careerplanning)
* [Giving talks](https://github.com/jtleek/talkguide)


The book is probably most suited to graduate students and postdocs in the sciences, but may be of interest to others who want to adapt their scientific process to use modern tools. 

The book has a suggested price of $10 but no minimum price and purchase include access to all updates to the book if you buy it on Leanpub.

Data analysis is at least as much art as it is science. This book is focused on the details of data analysis that sometimes fall through the cracks in traditional statistics classes and textbooks. It is based in part on the authors blog posts, lecture materials, and tutorials such as: 

* [10 things statistics taught us about big data analysis](http://simplystatistics.org/2014/05/22/10-things-statistics-taught-us-about-big-data-analysis/)
* [The Leek Group Guide to R packages](https://github.com/jtleek/rpackages)
* [How to share data with a statistician](https://github.com/jtleek/datasharing)

The author is one of the co-developers of the Johns Hopkins Specialization in Data Science the largest data science program in the world that has enrolled more than 1.76 million people. The book is useful as a companion to introductory courses in data science or data analysis. It is also a useful reference tool for people tasked with reading and critiquing data analyses. 

The book has a suggested price of $10 but no minimum price and purchase includes access to all updates to the book if you buy it on Leanpub.
