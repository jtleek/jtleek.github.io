title: Hi I'm Jeff

I work on figuring out how to go from raw data from
next generation sequencing machines to results, 
turning public genomic data into clinically useful tools, and 
understanding how people use data analysis in real life. 

I do [statistical research](/papers), write [data analysis software](/software), write a [blog about statistics](http://simplystatistics.org), [teach a few people here at Hopkins](/teaching), [teach a lot of people online](https://www.coursera.org/specialization/jhudatascience/1), and [work with amazing students](/people) who [go do awesome things](/alumni). 

If you want to keep up with everything we are working on, follow me on Twitter [@jtleek](http://twitter.com/jtleek).
